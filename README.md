The purpose of this project was to use scipy to find data about one specfic NBA player and his season data. I made classes Player, ThreePointAccuracy, LinearRegression, Integration, Interpolation, Stats, and TTests to help space out all the data. Each class had the limitations of player and reg_season but some had other such as self.accuracy or self.name.
